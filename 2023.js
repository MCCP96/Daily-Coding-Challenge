// H-Index II         1/1/2023

// Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

// Example 1:
//    Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
//    Output: 3
// Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
// Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

// Example 2:
//    Input: citations = [1,2,100]
//    Output: 2

// Constraints:
//    n == citations.length
//    1 <= n <= 105
//    0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
//    citations is sorted in ascending order.

const hIndex = (citations, i = 0) => {
  citations.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  for (; i < citations.length; i++) {
    if (citations[i] < i + 1) return i;
  }
  return i;
};
console.log(hIndex([0, 1, 3, 5, 6])); // 3
console.log(hIndex([1, 2, 100])); // 2

// Same as the H-Index I solved two days ago
// Probably not running in logarithmic time

var topVotedHIndex = function (citations) {
  let start = 0,
    end = citations.length - 1;
  while (start <= end) {
    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
    if (citations.length - mid - 1 < citations[mid]) end = mid - 1;
    else start = mid + 1;
  }
  return citations.length - start;
};

// Nice!
